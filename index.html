        <p><i>Bleach</i> is a Japanese anime television series based on <i>Tite Kubo</i>'s original manga series of the
            same name. It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo from
            October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after
            he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul
            Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil
            spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga series it is based
            on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines and characters not found in the
            source material.
